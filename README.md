# RapidKart — Quick Commerce User Behavior & Product Analytics

## Project Overview

RapidKart is an end-to-end **product analytics case study** built for a fictional quick commerce platform. The project analyzes user behavior, conversion funnels, retention, operational efficiency, and user segmentation to understand what drives growth and where users drop off.

The project covers: synthetic data generation, validation, Spark-based transformation, Gold-layer analytics tables, and dashboard-driven insights.

---

## Business Objective

This project answers key product questions:

- How do users move through the purchase funnel?
- Where do users drop off before completing an order?
- Does delivery speed impact conversion and retention?
- How does retention change over time?
- Which user segments contribute most to business value?

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Power BI

---

## Dataset Design

A **synthetic but realistic dataset** was created to simulate quick-commerce behavior for ~10,000 users across 90 days.

### Tables

#### Users
#### Events
Event types include:
app_open, product_view, add_to_cart, checkout_start, payment_success, order_placed, etc.

#### Orders

### Dataset Realism

The data simulates:
- cart abandonment
- payment failures
- delivery delays
- peak usage hours
- churn behavior
- user segmentation (regular, occasional, inactive)

---

## Architecture

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture**:

Raw Data → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Analysis → Dashboard

### Bronze Layer
Raw data ingestion

### Silver Layer
- cleaned data
- sessionization using window functions
- event enrichment

### Gold Layer
Analytics-ready tables:
- daily_kpis
- funnel_metrics
- retention_cohort
- user_summary

---

## Key Metrics

- Average DAU: 529.52  
- Total Orders: 9,425  
- Total Revenue: 49.59M  
- Conversion Rate: 19.63%  
- Avg Delivery Time: 17.68 minutes  

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Strong Growth with Stable Operations

RapidKart shows consistent growth in users, orders, and revenue. Importantly, delivery time remains stable (~17–18 minutes), indicating operations are scaling effectively alongside demand.

---

### 2. Checkout is the Biggest Funnel Bottleneck

Funnel analysis shows:

- App Open → Product View: 75.41%  
- Product View → Add to Cart: 66.41%  
- Add to Cart → Checkout: 57.20%  
- Checkout → Purchase: 69.78%  

The largest drop occurs at **Add to Cart → Checkout (~42.8% drop-off)**, indicating friction before purchase commitment.

---

### 3. Weak Retention After Early Usage

Retention is strong initially but declines sharply after early weeks. Users try the product but do not consistently return, indicating weak habit formation.

---

### 4. Delivery Time Impacts Conversion

- Correlation between delivery time and conversion: **-0.615**

Faster delivery (~16.7 min) results in higher conversion (~20.36%), while slower delivery (~18.9 min) reduces conversion (~18.98%).

Delivery performance directly impacts business outcomes.

---

### 5. Small User Segment Drives Value

User distribution:
- Occasional Users: 49.5%
- Inactive Users: 41.1%
- Regular Users: 9.36%

Regular users are highly valuable:
- 9.89 avg sessions
- 3.52 avg orders per user

Occasional users generate most orders, making them the biggest growth opportunity.
